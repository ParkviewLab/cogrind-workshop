# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are recorded here. Each release entry has two parts: a **Highlights** paragraph, generated at release time by an Anthropic-API call, and the **categorized changes**, the pull requests merged since the previous tag grouped by their [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) type, with any commit that reached the release without a pull request listed under Direct commits. Both are written by dev-tools' `generate-changelog`, which the release workflow runs at a pinned release.

The release workflow on every tag push regenerates both, commits the new
section here, and uses the same content as the GitHub Release body.
